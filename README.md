# OTP Bottom Sheet Experiment

An experimental project exploring how [OTPKit](https://github.com/manu-r12/otpkit) features could be seamlessly integrated into OneBusAway using bottom sheets over map interfaces.

## Purpose

This experiment demonstrates:
- **Bottom sheet integration** for OTP workflows in transit apps
- **Map + content coordination** similar to Apple Maps
- **SwiftUI content** presentation in existing UIKit map views
- **Smooth position transitions** for optimal map visibility during trip planning




## Demo Functionality

The example demonstrates:
1. **Full screen map** with floating controls
2. **Location list** in bottom sheet (simulating stops/routes)
3. **Tap list item** â†’ Sheet moves to tip position for better map visibility
4. **Smooth transitions** ideal for OTP user flows
